        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>
        Books!Books!Books! Was founded as an independent shop in Dundee, Scotland, in 2008 by Bernadette K. Buchs. Their aim was to provide the most obscure books to the obscure people who love to read them. 
        Today we are a multi-billion pound international business selling and reviewing a tiny and tightly-curated range of artisanal literature to the ever-growing market of book-collectors around the world. Many of our customers order hundreds of copies of the same book to fill their shelves and show off to their barely-sentient, easily-impressed friends.

        The original book store can still be seen at 23 Crannock Lane, Dundee. In 2021 it was bricked-up and encased in resin to preserve it for future generations. 
        For any questions, email us at info@booksbooksbooks.biz - we read every message.
